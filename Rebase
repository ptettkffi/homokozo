The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later that year (1991).[11][24] Version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994.[25]

Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, 
took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software-guru Richard Stallman's speech. 
Torvalds used Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel.

After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996,[4] Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 until June 2003. 
He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, 
under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon,[1] to be closer to the OSDL's Beaverton, 
Oregon-based headquarters.

From 1997 to 1999, he was involved in 86open helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. 
In 1999, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35.[26]

In 1999, Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with stock options in gratitude for his creation.[27] 
That same year both companies went public and Torvalds's share value temporarily shot up to roughly US$20 million.[28][29]

His personal mascot is a penguin nicknamed Tux,[30] which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the mascot of the Linux kernel.[31]

Although Torvalds believes "open source is the only right way to do software", he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job",
even if that includes proprietary software.[32] 
He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel.
Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called Git.

In 2008, Torvalds stated that he used the Fedora distribution of Linux because it had fairly good support for the PowerPC processor architecture, 
which he had favored at the time.[33] His usage of Fedora was confirmed in a later 2012 interview.[34] 
He has also posted updates about his choice of desktop environment, often in response to perceived feature regressions.

Currently, the Linux Foundation sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux.[35]

Linus Torvalds is known for disagreeing with other developers on the Linux kernel mailing list.[36]
Calling himself a "really unpleasant person", 
he later explained "I'd like to be a nice person and curse less and encourage people to grow rather than telling them they are idiots.
I'm sorry – I tried, it's just not in me."[37][38] His attitude, which Torvalds considers necessary for making his point clear,
has drawn criticism from Intel programmer Sage Sharp and systemd developer Lennart Poettering, among others.[39][40]
